# Why I choose List

I choose a list because it keeps order while dictionary and set are do not.
Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.
The elements in the lists can be accessed via indices while dictionary using key-value. It is easier to do use indices since the id value is automatically increment from 0 the same as the indices value upon creating an object.

Dictionary associates each key with a value, while list and set just contain values. It is very different use cases.

Set requires items to be hashable, list doesn't. Since for this assignment the items can be both hashable and non-hashable, therefore, I prefer to use list.
